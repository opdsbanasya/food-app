# Food App
This is a simple food app that allows users to search for recipes and save them to their favorites. The app uses the `Swiggy API` to display list of `restaurents`. The app is built using React and Redux for state management. The app is styled using [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). The app is tested using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`.
